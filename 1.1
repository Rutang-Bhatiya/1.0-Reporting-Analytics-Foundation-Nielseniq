##1.1 – Answers: SQL-Based Analytics Concepts
The **Answers** software functioned as a SQL-driven analytics layer.  
Although operated via a UI, the logic closely mapped to SQL concepts.

**Conceptual mapping:**
- Filters → `WHERE`
- Facts → `SELECT`
- Aggregations → `SUM`, `COUNT`
- Grouping → `GROUP BY`
- Time logic → calendar joins

**Example (conceptual SQL):**
```sql
SELECT
  market,
  product_hierarchy,
  SUM(sales_value) AS sales_value,
  SUM(volume) AS volume
FROM sales_data
WHERE market IN ('Total Market', 'Coop', 'Migros')
  AND period_type = 'MAT'
GROUP BY market, product_hierarchy;
